# Outlier-Detection
This repository contains code for generating unimodal, bimodal and trimodal data set. Then, the file entitled “Methods” contains our proposed algorithm along with dbscan and isolation forest. The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm which can detect anomalies of a data set without considering the number of modes.
